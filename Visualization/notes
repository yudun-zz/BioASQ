1. Need to do clustering analysis on these 2916 categories

2. Testing Visualize on "Buenos Aires":
    First Decide the similirities among questions;
    Then generate the adjacent matrix for these 541 nodes (for future larger sets, do pruning based on answer num)
    Using SVD to perform LSI to do clustering on them
    using several top singular vectors (10~15?) as concept nodes, derived the distance within each cluster to this node
    and using D3.js force directed to visualize them

3. Then Visualize 2916 categories using similar technique
